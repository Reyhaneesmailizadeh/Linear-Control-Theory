# Q1
A Damped mass-spring system with two degrees of freedom consists of two masses, two springs, and two dampers (similar to Figure 4). 
For the above system, first convert the governing differential equation into a parametric form using Simulink in MATLAB 
(pay attention to implementing the equation itself in this section).
Then, obtain the step response of the system simulated this way. Next, perform a diagonalization of the parametric equation, and for another system,
simply use the parametric equation conversion and compare the results.

Note: For this question, assume arbitrary values for the parameters.
# Q2
Considering the relation given in the lesson for a DC motor, examine the effect of different values of inertia on the step response of the system. 
Refer to a constant value for other parameters with reference to a source. (Mention your source.)
